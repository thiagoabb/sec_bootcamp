= Introduction

This course is an introduction to the fundamental of data security with
emphases on technologies used in securing Cloudera's Data Center centric technologies.

== Security Basics

Two rules you should always remember

1. Security is not binary, it is not on or off but a measure of degees where 100% can
never be achieved
1. You are never done. One layer of protection is never good enough and alaways assume human error

=== Defence in Depth

Often data security is discussed in terms of defence in depth using the castle analogy

A castle has multiple layers of protection before the inner chambers can be reached

* Large open field around the castle
* Moat
* Defending wall
* Many interior rooms
* In the center of all that the crown jewels.

With data security we typically deploy

* Perimeter security with routing rules
* Network security with firewalls
* Host Security within Linux
* Application security with the code of the app
* Data security within encryption

Though different applications work differently and the stack and implementation changes
all layers can be breached so multiple layers are critical.

*Never not be afraid!* Stay paranoid, stay vigilant

== The Hadoop problem

Security in a distributed computing environment was a foreign concept until Hadoop
came along. Many of the core assumptions which could be made in regular environments
were void in a distributed environment. Assumptions regarding inter process security
and authentication.

The fundamentals of Security (in our world) means:

* Authentication
  ** Kerberos
  ** KNOX
  ** LDAP
* Authorization
  ** Ranger
  ** LDAP
* Encryption
  ** TLS
  ** TDE
  ** Nav Encrypt
* Audit
  ** Ranger

The space is very complex with weird interdependencies and complex integration schemas.

During this course we will go through all of the steps required to secure a basic cluster,
with pointers to where to get information for more complex topics such as HSM integration.

Each topic of security will be introduced in the order in which it will be applied
to the cluster.

Each section will include:

* A video outlining the basics of the technology
* An ASCII doc with bullet point notes of the content covered in the video with expansisons and links
* Hands on exercises to practice using the technology.

At the end of the course each student will have a fully secured cluster they have built from scratch

=== The security paradox

Security experts want to lock down system to the nth degree

Users still need to do their job, if security impedes them from doing their job

* Workarounds are used
* Escalations occur to reduce security
* Tensions escalate

Find the balance, secured systems need to let people do their job!
