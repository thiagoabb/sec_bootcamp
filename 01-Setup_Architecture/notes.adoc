= Cloudera Security Introduction.

In the 1.0 version of every components that makes up the CDP stack there was
no security.

* Security was an add on for every component
* Might see some idiosyncrasies
* Needs to be extendable
* Sometimes not consistent across products in our stack ( though we are working on it ).

When developing a security framework

* Integrate with known technologies
** Don't role your own if you can, too much heavy lifting
** Too risky as lots of security integration
* Using know tested libraries
** Make sure they are constantly tested
** New vulnerabilities come up all of the time you don't want to hold the bag every time
* Consider end users.
** The hard it is it use, the more they will compromise security
** They they have 50 password there will be a password.txt in the desktop

== Cloudera Security Overview

10,000 ft view of what it means to secure a CDP deployment.

Remember we are *securing Data*. We need to block:
* access to data
* access to tools that can give you access today
* access to information that help you get access to data

Everything else we don't care about

=== Security Pillars and products

* Authentication ( Who are you )
** Some way to uniquely identify who are you
** SSO capabilities are needed as you don't constantly ask for password
* Authorization ( What are you allowed to do )
** Usually based on membership for some sort to
* Encryption ( No peaking )
** Wire encryption messages sent over the network
** On Disk encryption to stop dumpster diving
* Auditing ( Trust but verify )
** Need a tool to capture and warn if something unusually is occurring
** If something happens need to be able to to forensics
* Perimeter ( Minimize exposure )
** The fewer ways for an attacker to get in the better
** Don't want to spread out too thin. Closing doors let's you focus on key areas

=== Security By Pillar

Authentication:

* Kerberos
** all you need to know `export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs` needs to be stopped
** Great for SSO like capabilities, no re-entering passwords
* KNOX
** Many UIs in CDP, with different authentication mechanisms.
** KNOX is one gateway to rule them all
** Also great for SSO like capabilities, one login to KNOX is all you need

Authorization:

* Ranger
** Once you login, not all data should be available
** Plugin based framework, one plugin per service in CDP
** Policy based system for allowing and denying access to data
** Based on Data Tagging and or group membership
* Atlas
** Keep track for tags for athorization
** Great if you want to grough things together by human logic
* HDFS
** Built in ACLS
** Standard link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX[POSIX] stuff, can be used when ranger plus is no there.

Wire Encryption:

* Transparent Data Encryption
** If bypassing authentication no access to data in HDFS
* Navigator Encrypt
** If bypassing authentication no access to data ( for Kafka and Kudu )

Auditing

* Provided by Ranger
** Plugin framework
** Stores audio information in central backend ( HDFS or Solr ).
** Solr only for n day Cache for rapid search

=== Critical Integration

* Users from Kerberos
* Groups from directory service
* Groups sometimes pulled from OS

Needs:

1. Kerberos and Directory service to share user cache.
2. OS and Directory service show the same users and groups

==== Kerberos and Directory service integration

Three Options

1. Microsoft Active Directory
1. IBM / Redhat IPA
1. Role your own ( manual integration of Kerberos and Directory service
* DON'T DO MANUAL INTEGRATION. TOO BRITTLE, TOO HARD.

==== OS and Directory service integration

Two options

1. Centrify
* Costs Money
1. SSSD
* Free, built into linux

We don't care, both work just down use Winbind, it's too slow and crashes our system.


=== Microsoft Active Directory ( AD )

Active directory is a bundeling of different security products by Microsoft.
Included in Active Directory are the following components which will be used for securing the Hadoop Cluster

*  Kerberos
*  Directory Service
*  Certificate Authority
*  NTP
*  DNS

Features:

* Kerberos and Directory Service pre integrated
* Active Directory can be used as a single source of truth for both authentication and authorization
* User in Kerberos same as users in Directory, with same password
* Desktops usually interacted with AD so same password as login.


=== Free IPA / RedHat IdM

IPA is a packaging of different open source tools to provide complete security solution,
* very similar to Microsoft Active Directory but only for Linux

Integrated security information management solution combining:

*  MIT Kerberos
*  389 Directory Server
*  Dogtag certificate system
*  NTP
*  DNS
*  SSSD

Integration to IPA is very similar to AD or the individual products.


=== Order of operations for security deployment:

1. Configure and Enable TLS encryption on the cluster
1. Configure and enable Kerberos on the Hadoop cluster
1. Deploy OS Ldap binding ( SSSD )
1. Configure KNOX for Cloudera Manager, HUE, Impala and Hive and other interfaces
1. Enable and configure Ranger
1. Depoy Atlas and configure Ranger integration
1. Deploy data at rest Encryption
1. Perform Security Hardening
