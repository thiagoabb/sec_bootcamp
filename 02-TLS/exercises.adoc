== TLS Lab

To understand the TLS process we are going to deploy TLS manually for a single host. Once we succeeded with that process
we we will deploy TLS for all services using automated scripts.

If you are looking for sample commands looking into link:./resources/example.adoc[Sample commands]

== TLS Lab Prepare

* Create an Issue called `TLS labs`
** Add it to the Lab milestone
** Label the issue as `started`
** Assign yourself to the Issue

=== Manually Deploy TLS for the Cloudera Manager Web UI.

NOTE: For sample commands for all of these tasks and more look in link:link:./resources/example.adoc[the samples file in resoources].

1. Login to Cloudera Manager Server host ( linux terminal ) and use openssl generate a key pair and CSR for the CM server.
* Make sure all rules for certs are followed  both client and server authentication and digital signatures and encryption
* To make life easier use a link:http://web.mit.edu/crypto/openssl.cnf[cnf file] and run the req command with -config sample.cnf
* In the resources folder there is a link:./resources/sample.cnf[Sample cnf file]
* Use openssl to display the content of the csr and put the output in the file lab/csr.adoc

1. Sign the certificate with Cloudera Internal Certificate Authority
* Documentation and examples on how to sign certificates can be found link:https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CS/pages/388038742/cfssl+Command+Line+Api+certificate+services[in the wiki]

1. use openssl to display the content of the cert. Please the command and result in `labs/cm_cert.adoc`

1. Concatenate the intermediate CA pem file and the certificate in to the same file.
link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000333504&language=en_US&type=1&mode=1[Here] is an example of how it should look like

1. Create a JKS file with this newly generated cert concatenate. Place the commands used to create the JKS from the pem files in lab/jks.adoc
* You might need to first generate a pkcs12 and load the pkcs12 into a jks
* This will be you keystore file

1. Download the certificate for the Cloudera internal CA link:https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/388038742/cfssl-rootCA.pem?api=v2[from this location]
* Create a JKS version of the CA certificate
* This will  be your truststore file

1. Put the keystore JKS and truststore JKS is a known location such as "/opt/cloudera/security" and make sure the "cloudera_scm" user has access to the folder

1. Enable TLS for the CM console only.
* Follow the instructions in the link:https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/how_to_configure_cm_tls.html#concept_gj4_g5d_xn[public documentation]
* ONLY enable TLS for CM server an not the agents as well

1. If you get a TLS certiicate verification error upload the CA certificate into your browser
* Instructions available around the internet. For Chrome a possible source is  link:https://support.globalsign.com/digital-certificates/digital-certificate-installation/install-client-digital-certificate-windows-using-chrome[this documentation]

1. Place a screenshot of the CM login page in lab/cm_tls.png make sure you show the URL and the fact that TLS is working.
* You may click on the lock beside the url to display the validity of the certificate

1. Undo the CM configuration and disable TLS for CM
* This is to prepare for doing the entire process though an automated script.
* If using Chrome make sure you clear browser cache once disabling TLS, otherwise it will auto default to TLS enable URL

=== Deploy TLS for the cluster using "Auto_TLS"

We now need to deploy TLS to all nodes and configure services to use TLS. The procedure is:

1. Create CSR with private key for every node.

* This can be done with a single bash command. Example command is:
* `for i in {1..6}; do export FQDN=<your_host_names>-$i.gce.cloudera.com; openssl req -out $FQDN.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout $FQDN.key -config test.cnf -passout pass:<private_key_password> -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Somewhere/O=Cloudera./OU=Basecamp/CN=$FQDN" ; done`

* This command references the CNF file so make sure you point to the correct CNF file. Further you need
to have the SAN section of the CNF file contain `DNS.1  = ${ENV::FQDN}` Make sure that is there,
and not commented out. Otherwise the certificates generated will not work.

2. Tar up the CSRs and copy all of the CSR to the cfssl server to sign the certificates. Same process as before
everything is link:https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CS/pages/388038742/cfssl+Command+Line+Api+certificate+services#Using-the-cfssl-client-host-(simplest-approach)[documented in the wiki]

3. Once you have the signed certificates available bring them back to your CM machine and prepare
a folder "/opt/cloudera/AutoTLS" with

* All of the signed certificates
* All of private keys corresponding to the certificates
* A file containing the private key password ( this will be your keystore password )
* A file containing the truststore password ( this is a net new password you create )
* A file containing the root can intermediate CA certificate.


4. Make sure the folder is owned by cloudera-scm user and than run the CURL command to enable TLS for the cluster
Sample CURL command can be found in the link:https://blog.cloudera.com/auto-tls-in-cloudera-data-platform-data-center/[Cloudera Blog on auto TLS]

* Look under the section "Option 2b â€“ Enabling Auto-TLS with Existing Certificates"
* Yes you will need to enter the certificates for the CM server twice in the 2 different section
* Yes this will be made easier in the next release of CM ( sorry )

5. Take the command used to generate the CSRs and the curl command and put them in the file `lab/auto_TLS.adoc`

6. Makes sure everything is green after restarting CM, Agents and Cluster
* If your agents don't heartbeat after reboot of the agent ( look under hosts -> all hosts ) check the
agent config file ( /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini ). Look for the paranter "server_host=", make sure
it's the FQDN and not the IP address of CM for the value of that parameter. IP is OK only when TLS is not
enabled!!!

IMPORTANT: Never user the same password for the Keystore and the Truststore. Keystore password
protects the private key and should be secured. Truststore password protects the certificate
of the CA and is often given out and stored in insecure ways.


=== Close things out
