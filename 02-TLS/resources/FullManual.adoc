== Going full manual, deprecated.

=== Typical Algorithm:

1.  Generate a private and public key pair in a JKS
* Command: keytool -genkeypair
2.  Generate a Certificate Signing Request
* Command: keytool -certreq
3.  Import The signed certificate into to keystore
* Command: keytool -importcert
* Alias must match the alias of the private key otherwise the import will fail
4.  Export the cert and key into a PKCS12 file to convert cert and key to pem format
* Command: keytool -importkeystore
5.  Extract the certificate from the PKCS12 file
* Command: openssl pkcs12 -nokeys -out
6.  Extract the key form the PKCS12 file
* Command: openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out
7.  Create a password file with the keystore password for the Cloudera Manager Agent
* Command: echo “<Password>” > passwd.txt

Once The certificates are created following the instruction to enable TLS for the various components 

To enable TLS for Cloudera Manager follow the instructions at the links:
