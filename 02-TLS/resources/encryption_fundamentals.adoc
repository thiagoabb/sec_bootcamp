= Principals of Encryption

There are 2 basic types of encryption

* symmetric key encryption
* asymmetric key encryption

Symmetric is where the encryption key = decryption key

Asymmetric is where the encryption key != decryption key

=== Symetric Key Encryption

This is the most popular form of encryption with hundreds of different implementation. 

Currently the most popular (and secure) implementation is AES. 
Hardware accelerated via the Intel AES-NI extensions

=== Simple Example

The simplest symetric encryption algorithm can be XOR 

Encrypted Message = Original Message XOR Key

Decryped Message  = Encrypted Message XOR Key

For example if we have: 

....
Message = 0x45
Key = 0X96

Encrypted Message = Original Message XOR Key
                  =       0x45       XOR 0x96
                  =       0xD3

Decryped Message  = Encrypted Message XOR Key
                  =         0xD3      XOR 0x96
                  =         0x45
....

=== Simple Example with AES

```bash
1. echo "secret message" > message.txt
2. openssl enc -e -aes256 -in message.txt -out lockedmessage.txt -k fedcba9876
3. cat lockedmessage.txt

4. openssl enc -d -aes256 -out originalmessage.txt -in lockedmessage.txt -k fedcba9876
5. cat originalmessage.txt

   secret message

```
....
Command options used:
       -e = encrypt
       -d = decrypt
       -k = symetric key
       -in = input file
       -out = output file
....

=== Limitations of Symetric Key Encryption

A secure method is required for exchange the secret key.

If you can meet at starbucks and exchange the Key that will work

When connecting to your bank's webservice to do online banking that is not an option

== Asymmetric Key Encryption

Asymetric Key Encryption (sometimes called public key cryptography) uses 2 distinct keys for encryption and decryption
Encryption key can be made public to everybody without exposing any encrypted messages

This relies on complex mathematics. First implementation published in 1977 (ish)[1] by:
Ron **R**ivest, Adi **S**hamir, and Leonard **A**dleman called the RSA algorithm.

=== RSA Key Creation


1. Choose two different large random prime numbers _p_, and _q_
2. Calculate _n_ = _p * q_
4. Calculate the totient: _phi(n)_ = _(p-1)(q-1)_
5. Choose an integer _e_, such that 1 < _e_, < _phi(n)_ and _e_, is coprime to phi(n)
   _e_, is released as the public key exponent
7. Compute _d_, to satisfy the congruence relation _d * e ≡ 1_ or  _d * e_ = 1 + _k * phi(n)_, for some integer _k_
   _d_ is kept as the private key exponent

Public Key = ( _n_ , _e_)

Private Key = ( _n_ , _d_ ) 

Encrypt Message = c = _m^e^ mod n_

Decrypt Message = m =_c^d^ mod n_


==== "Simple" Numerical Example

....
p = 11
q = 13
e = 17

n = p * q
  = 11 * 13
n = 143

phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
       = (11 - 1) * (13 - 1)
       = 10 * 12
phi(n) = 120

d * e ≡ 1_
d * e mod phi(n) = 1
d * 17 mod 120 = 1
....

....
113* 17 = 16 * 120 + 1
d = 113

Public Key = ( n , e)
= ( 143 , 17 )

Private Key = ( n , d )
= ( 143 , 113 )

Message = 9

....

Encrypt Message = _m^e^ mod n_
= 9^17^ mod 143
= 81

Decrypt Message = _c^d^ mod n_
= 81^113^ mod 143
= 9

Observations

1. The message can not be bigger then n since the mod n would corrupt the message
2. Encrypting and Decrypting messages is very computationally expensive since exponents of large numbers are required
3. Stand formats for Public and Private Key containers would be useful

=== Typical Use Pattern for Encryption

Asymmetric key cryptography is expensive to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
Symmetric key cryptography has no way to transfer the key

Hence we combine. Use asymmetric key cryptography to security exchange a Symmetric key and exchange data
using the symetric key. TLS, GPG et al. use this method
