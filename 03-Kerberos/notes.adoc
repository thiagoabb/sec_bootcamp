== Introduction

Authentication is the practice of checking you are who you say you are.

Typically linux uses the login system to verify your identity. In a distributed system this is insufficient.

If you have elevated privileges on one of the nodes ( edge node for example ) it does not mean you should have elevated privileges on the cluster.
 
For example if you are root on any edge node ( a server where the config XMLs are deployed ). You can run the command
 
user@edge:~$ export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs; hdfs dfs -rm -r /

To prevent this, we need to use external (to the cluster) authentication system

2 Different external authentication mechanisms available:

* Kerberos
* Directory Service

=== Kerberos

Kerberos is an authentication system built in the 80's at MIT.
 
- It was designed to use a ticketing system to allow for authentication over hostile channel (non trusted network)
- Uses a ticketing system to authenticate users
- Implements single sign-on system i.e. you only need to authenticate once, on subsequent accesses no password is required
- Designed to use a trusted third party ( Kerberos Server ) to administer authentication
- Underpins most modern authentication mechanisms
- Integrated into Microsoft Active Directory, and RedHat Free IPA out of the box

An over-simplified view of Kerberos

1. Client makes request to AS for a TGT (kinit)
1. AS check password database and creates a TGT encrypted with userâ€™s password
3. Client decrypts messages with password and stores TGT
4. Client makes a request to TGS for a Service Ticket (ST) with its TGT to access a particular service
5. TGS sends back a ST with a service secret
6. Client sends the ST to the Service to authenticate itself. Service checks the validity of the ticket and accepts the request
7. Optional: Service sends back its secret for the client to authenticate it

A grouping of all elements in one system is called a Kerberos REALM,

NOTE: Watch the video for a full deep dive on Kerberos

==== Limitation of Kerberos

Kerberos does not implement the concept of groups, not any other type of data associated with users. 
In this case Kerberos can not be used for authorization only authentication.

A directory service is used as the authorization backend. More on directory service in the next chapter.

=== CDP and Kerberos

To secure Hadoop services, everything starts with Kerberos

* Every role type of every service gets its own Kerberos credentials
* Users prove their identity to obtain a Kerberos ticket
* A valid ticket is honored by Hadoop service components

Hadoop components also authenticate to each other for intra- and inter-service communication

An external kerberos serer is required. There are the options in order of preference:

1. Microsoft AD (Active Directory)
1. Redhat / IBM IPA (Identity, Policy, and Audit)
1. MIT Kerberos

The first two are full identity provider, while the last is just a kerberos implementation.

When on site with a customer, *integrate with Microsoft AD* unless conferring with a senior SA first.

Cloudera Manager provides a wizard to automate the provisioning of service accounts and the associated keytabs

Blog on the integration is AD available

=== AD Requirements

To Integrate CDP with AD you need the following:

* At least one AD domain controller is setup with LDAPS
* A dedicated OU in your desired AD domain
* An AD account for Cloudera Manager that has create/modify/delete user privileges on this OU
** This is not a domain admin / administrative account!
* Install openldap-clients on the CM server host, krb5-workstation on every host

When asking a customer for AD account for Cloudera Manager you will get pushback as it violates IT policy.
Use the following points to convince them

* The user can be kept disabled most of the time and is only needed for:
** Initial setup
** Deployment of new services
** Deployment of new servers ( nodes )
* Users will only be created in a single OU which can be audited after creation
* The password is stored security in the CM backend and th CM admin does not need to know the password.
It can be entered one time by AD admin during setup
* Passwords for users are randomly generated based on editable specifications by the system, no user interaction
* The code that generates the users is open source and can be audited.


=== Kerberos config file required for client ( /etc/krb5.conf )

Contains three primary sections to understand: libdefaults, realms, and domain_realm

* libdefaults
** Contains general configurations that are not specific to a given realm
* realms
** Lists the realms and associated KDCs for them
* domain_realm
** Maps DNS domains to Kerberos realms

See sample krb5.conf file link:./resources/krb5.conf[krb5.conf]

Full the full documentation on the krb5.conf see
link:https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html[MIT documentation]

Once the kerberos client RPM has been installed and the krb5.conf is configured the machine is a Kerberos client.
Your labtop can be a client for Kerberos.


=== SASL QOP Notes

Most of EDH uses TLS for wire encryption

Some services use "SASL"

* Umbrella security suite of protocols and methods

Quality of protection (QoP)

* Extension of Kerberos authentication (typically)
* Three modes: authentication (auth), integrity (auth-int), privacy (auth-conf)

Used in a few places

* HDFS RPC encryption
* HDFS DataNode transfer encryption
* HBase RPC/transfer encryption
* HBase thrift server
