= Ranger Exercise

== Ranger Lab Prepare

* Create an Issue called `Ranger labs`
** Add it to the Lab milestone
** Label the issue as `started`
** Assign yourself to the Issue

=== Setup the Data

Take the file `resources/data.csv` from the repo and upload it into your cluster as a table

* you may think that is trivial, I assure you it is not
* You can use any path you would like, one path can be
1. Copy the file onto one of the node of the cluster
2. Load the file into home folder in HDFS
3. Login to HUE and use the importer tool to create a table

=== Setup Users & Groups

Remember hadoop takes the user from the kerberos principal

* kinit some_dude@MYREALM -> user is some_dude ( does not matter your linux user )

Groups are extracted from the OS with the `id -GN` or (`getent` for ranger) command.

* so the OS groups some_dude is what you authorise in Ranger

Hence on all machines setup the following users an groups via SSSD.

|===
|User |Group

|basecamp_no_pii_user
|basecamp_no_pii_access

|basecamp_us_user
|basecamp_us_access

|basecamp_evening_user
|basecamp_evening_access

|basecamp_eu_user
|basecamp_eu_access

=== Deploy Security Tools

1. Deploy Infra Solr on one of the worker nodes of the cluster
1. Deploy HBase on at least one of the worker nodes of the cluster
1. Deploy Kafka across 3 of the worker nodes of the cluster
1. Deploy Ranger on one of the Master servers in the cluster
1. Go though each service in CM and make sure the Ranger Authorization check box is ticked.
* For example in HDFS the propery is called `Enable Ranger Authorization`
* Some more information link:https://docs.cloudera.com/cloudera-manager/7.0.3/installation/topics/cdpdc-additional-steps-ranger.html[in the documentation]
1. Go into Ranger and see if the plugins are available.
* If the plugin do not show up in each category you might need to "Setup Ranger Pligin Service".
It is an option in the ranger CM page under Actions.

=== Ranger Policies

Login to Ranger and configure the following Policies on the data table you created above

1. basecamp_no_pii_user should not see the pii data columns. That is Age and Address
using link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-resource-based-column-masking-in-hive-with-ranger-policies.html[column making]
1. Grant access to your table to basecamp_no_pii_user and basecamp_us_user using link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-resource-policy-configure-hive.html[resource based policy]
1. basecamp_no_pii_user should not see the data in the the pii columns. That is Age and Address
using link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-resource-based-column-masking-in-hive-with-ranger-policies.html[column masking]
1. basecamp_us_user should only see rows of data where the location is us
using link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-row-level-filtering-in-hive-with-ranger-policies.html[row level filtering]
1. basecamp_evening_user should only see the data during the evening using
link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-time-bound-policy-create.html[time-bound policy]
1. basecamp_no_pii_user should not be allowed to query Age and Address columns at the same time using link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/RANGER/Ranger+-+DGI+Hive+Prohibition+Policy[prohibition policies]

==== Bonus

1. Allow all users to access their own HDFS user directory using link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-resource-policies-wildcards-variables.html [variables]
1. Create a new Security Zone and assign any resource in your cluster to that zone. Assign a zone admin and create one policies on that resource. link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-security-zones.html[Security Zone documentation]
1. Be creative! What other types of policies can you come up with?


=== Demonstrate policies are working

1. Login to the terminal on the gateway node.
1. Make sure you can login to beeline. Use the link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/starting-hive/topics/hive_start_hive_as_authorized_user.html[documentation to help]
1. Login to beeline as each of the four users ( kinit <user>; beeline ...  ) and run selects from `default.data` that demonstrate the policy outputs. Take that output and place it in
`lab/1_beeline.adoc`
1. Examine the Ranger Audits and search for entries from your users which show the policies in action. Take screenshots and put them in the `labs` directory, one image per user called `labs/2_audits.png`.
1. Export all of the resource based policies link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/security-ranger-authorization/topics/security-ranger-resource-policies-export-for-all-services.html[Follow the documentation] and put the exported file in `labs/3_policies.csv`
