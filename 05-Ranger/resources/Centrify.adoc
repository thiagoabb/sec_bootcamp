<H1> SSSD and Sentrify </H1>

Integration between the OS and your Directory Service is critical for security to work. There are 2 implementation cloudera recommends:
 
 * SSSD
 * Centrify
 
 There are many more tools which can be used, but are quite old, and are not supported by Cloudera:
 
 * Winbind
 * YPBind ( NIS )

To deploy Centrify use the following blog as a guide:
