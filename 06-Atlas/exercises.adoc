If you are looking for an end to end tutorual ( be it a bit old) look at the link:https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/tag-based-policies-with-apache-ranger-and-apache-atlas/2.html[following link]

=== Demonstrate policies are working

1. Login to the terminal on the gateway node.
1. Make sure you can login to beeline. Use the link:https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.0.3/starting-hive/topics/hive_start_hive_as_authorized_user.html[documentation to help]
1. Login to beeline as each of the four users ( kinit <user>; beeline ...  ) and run selects from `default.data` that demonstrate the policy outputs. Take that output and place it in
`lab/1_beeline.adoc`

=== Bonus

1. Explore the Atlas plugin in Ranger.
1. Create a ranger polciy which prevents  basecamp_no_pii_access for seeing the PII tags
1. Take a screenshot of Atlas logged in as basecamp_no_pii_user showing they can not see the tags
